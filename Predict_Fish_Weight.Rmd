# Predicting Fish Weight




## Perch


```{r}
library(leaps)

    regsubsets(Weight ~ .,
               data = Perch,
               nbest = 1,       # 1 best model for each number of predictors
               nvmax = NULL,    # NULL for no limit on number of variables
               force.in = NULL, force.out = NULL,

as.data.frame(summary.out$outmat)
library(car)

```



### Best Models

The best model for perch is Width and Height.

### Best Two regressor model

The best two regressor model is also width and height

## Pike

```{r}
Pike = filter(All_Fish,Species=="Pike")
```

```{r}
Pike = select(Pike, -Species)
```

```{r}
library(leaps)
regsubsets.out <-
    regsubsets(Weight ~ .,
               data = Pike,
               nbest = 1,       # 1 best model for each number of predictors
               nvmax = NULL,    # NULL for no limit on number of variables
               force.in = NULL, force.out = NULL,

library(car)
subsets(regsubsets.out,statistic="adjr2",legend="bottomright",main="Adjusted R^2")
```

### Best Models

The best model is the L1,L2,L3,H,W because we see this is rated highest on the graph. It has a .98 rateing compared to everything else. 

### Best Two regressor model

The best two regressor models are 

## Roach
